## About this lab

### Tech stack

- C++
- [Qt](https://www.qt.io)

### Goal of the project

The goal was to create a state machine that would replicate the behavior of the following microwave:

A few other requirements included:
- save the new micropubs on the server so that data is not lost when server is stopped and relaunched
- reordering the micropubs based on their date
